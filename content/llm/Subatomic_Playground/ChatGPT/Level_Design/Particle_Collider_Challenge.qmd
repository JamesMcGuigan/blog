### Puzzle Level: Particle Collider Challenge

#### **Concept**

In "Particle Collider Challenge," players simulate particle collision experiments within a virtual collider to discover new particles. By adjusting the speed and angle of colliding particles, players must achieve specific outcomes and analyze the results to identify the particles produced.

#### **Objective**

Successfully adjust the speed and collision angle of particles to produce desired outcomes in the collider. Analyze the collision data to identify and catalog new particles.

#### **Mechanics**

1. **Speed Controls**

   - **Velocity Adjustment**: Players can set the velocity of particles entering the collider using a slider interface. Higher velocities increase the energy of collisions, affecting the potential outcomes.
   - **Energy Levels**: Display energy levels associated with different speeds to help players understand the relationship between speed and collision energy.

2. **Collision Angle**

   - **Angle Adjustment**: Players can adjust the angle of particle approach to optimize collision conditions. A precise angle increases the probability of a successful collision.
   - **Trajectory Visualization**: Show the predicted paths of particles before and after collision to assist in angle adjustments.

3. **Data Analysis**

   - **Result Interpretation**: After each collision, players receive data visualizations of the collision event, including particle tracks and energy signatures.
   - **Particle Identification**: Analyze the data to identify particles based on their unique signatures, such as mass, charge, and decay paths.
   - **Catalog System**: Maintain a catalog of discovered particles, including known particles and newly hypothesized ones.

#### **User Interaction**

1. **Initial Setup**

   - **Scenario Introduction**: Start with an animated sequence introducing the collider and the importance of particle discovery in physics.
   - **Interactive Tutorial**: Sheldon Cooper provides guidance on using the speed and angle controls, explaining the principles behind particle collisions.

2. **Gameplay Interaction**

   - **Control Interface**: Players use touch controls or a mouse to adjust speed and angle settings for the collider.
   - **Real-time Feedback**: Visual and auditory cues provide immediate feedback on the collision outcomes, showing how adjustments affect the results.

3. **Challenges and Iteration**

   - **Experimentation**: Encourage players to experiment with different speeds and angles, learning through trial and error.
   - **Progressive Difficulty**: As players advance, introduce more complex challenges, such as multiple particle types or varying environmental conditions.

#### **Solution**

1. **Optimal Collision Setup**

   - **Speed Calibration**: Set the velocity to match the energy required for desired particle outcomes. Use visual indicators to confirm optimal energy levels.
   - **Angle Precision**: Adjust the angle to maximize collision efficiency, using trajectory visualizations as a guide.

2. **Successful Analysis**
