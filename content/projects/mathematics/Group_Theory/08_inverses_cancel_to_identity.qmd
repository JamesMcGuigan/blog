**Formal statement:**

$$
g \cdot g^{-1} = g^{-1} \cdot g = e
$$

## Why does doing something and then undoing it return you to the start?

Imagine you're standing at the entrance of a forest. From there, you choose to walk along a certain path, noting carefully each step and each turn. After walking some distance, you stop. At this point, you have completed a journey—call this journey $( g )$.

Now, suppose you want to return exactly to where you started. To do so, you retrace your steps precisely, walking backwards along the exact same path you traveled. This retracing of your original journey is what we call the "inverse" of your original journey, written $( g^{-1} )$.

When you've retraced every step back, you inevitably end up exactly at your starting point, as if you'd never left. This original position, before you embarked on your journey, is the identity position, denoted as $( e )$. It represents "doing nothing," or "no change" from your original state.

Thus, the combined action—first doing something $( g )$, and then precisely undoing it $( g^{-1} )$ —leaves you exactly where you began $( e )$. Similarly, it doesn't matter if you think of undoing first and then doing; the symmetry remains the same. In either case, the final outcome is the identity: nothing has changed.

This intuitive picture underlies the formal mathematical fact:

$$
g \cdot g^{-1} = g^{-1} \cdot g = e
$$

Therefore, any action followed by its precise reversal naturally cancels out, returning you perfectly to your starting position.
