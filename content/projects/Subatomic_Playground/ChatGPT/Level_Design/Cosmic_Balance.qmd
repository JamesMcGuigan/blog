### Puzzle Level: Cosmic Balance

#### **Concept**

In "Cosmic Balance," players are tasked with arranging planets and stars within a solar system to create stable orbits. This puzzle introduces players to the principles of gravity and orbital dynamics, emphasizing the delicate balance required to maintain celestial harmony without collision.

#### **Objective**

Successfully adjust the mass and position of celestial bodies to create a stable solar system, ensuring that all planets and stars remain in orbit without colliding over an extended period.

#### **Mechanics**

1. **Orbit Controls**

   - **Mass Adjustment**: Players can adjust the mass of planets and stars, influencing their gravitational pull. Increasing mass strengthens gravity, affecting nearby orbits.
   - **Positioning**: Players can drag and place celestial bodies within the system, altering initial positions to optimize gravitational interactions.

2. **Real-time Feedback**

   - **Orbital Paths Visualization**: Display predicted orbital paths of celestial bodies in real-time, allowing players to see how adjustments impact stability.
   - **Collision Alerts**: Provide warnings when two bodies are on a collision course, encouraging corrective action.

3. **Time Lapse**

   - **Fast-forward Feature**: Enable players to accelerate time and observe the long-term effects of their configurations, helping them identify potential instability before it occurs.
   - **Historical Playback**: Allow players to review previous simulations, providing insight into how changes affect system dynamics.

#### **User Interaction**

1. **Initial Setup**

   - **Scenario Introduction**: Begin with an overview of the solar system, highlighting the importance of stable orbits for system longevity.
   - **Interactive Tutorial**: Einstein explains the basics of gravity and orbital mechanics, guiding players on how to use the controls effectively.

2. **Gameplay Interaction**

   - **Control Interface**: Players use drag-and-drop functionality to position bodies and sliders to adjust mass, with intuitive controls for ease of use.
   - **Feedback Systems**: Dynamic indicators show gravitational forces and potential collisions, updating in real-time as players make adjustments.

3. **Challenges and Iteration**

   - **Problem-solving**: Encourage players to experiment with different configurations, learning from each attempt.
   - **Progressive Complexity**: Introduce additional challenges, such as binary star systems or varying planetary densities, to increase difficulty as players advance.

#### **Solution**

1. **Optimal Configuration**

   - **Gravitational Balance**: Achieve a balance where gravitational forces between celestial bodies maintain stable orbits without collisions.
   - **Predictive Analysis**: Use the time-lapse feature to ensure the configuration remains stable over a simulated extended period.

2. **Stable Solar System**

   - **Equilibrium**: All planets and stars maintain their orbits, with paths that avoid intersections or destabilizing gravitational influences.
   - **Validation**: Receive confirmation of stability through visual indicators and a successful simulation outcome.

#### **Prize**
